# Azure Resource Manager Template examples

This is my collection of resource manager templates. It's intended use is to learn & explore.

## Requirements

All templates require that you have a subscription and an account with privileges to create resources. And you should be logged in via the command line.

```
az login --username my.name@mydomain.com
```

or if you use multi-factor authentication, use only

```
az login
```
